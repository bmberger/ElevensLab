WHAT I LIKED: I enjoyed relating a practical topic of cards into code. It was an interesting path to take. 

WHAT I HAD DIFFICULTY WITH: I had a hard time implementing isLegal and anotherPlayIsPossible because I didnâ€™t think through that I could use containsPairSum11 and containsJQK. I eventually realized the implementation after some trial and error.
